                <p>
                    I was tasked with creating something using the processing.js application utilising my knowledge of Java the only caveat being
                    I had to use a goose in there somewhere due to the association with Geese and Aston University (my university). The outcome was
                    a game where the player controls a red square and runs around the screen collecting the Geese eggs whilst running away from a Goose,
                    the goose gets faster everytime the player collects 4 eggs as well as the eggs randomly spawning around the screen everytime 4 have been collected.
                    A few extra notes are the goose has one eye that is constantly fixed on the player as they are running around and the player can run off 
                    the screen and appear on the opposite side of the screen rather than disappearing.
                    I received a first class grade for this assignment and I am very proud of the outcome considering the work I put into it.

                        The second assignment I was tasked with at University was to create a piece of software that allows a customer to purchase products and services, 
                        refunding the items and working out delivery costs based on weight. I created an ArrayList of products and services to allows the customer to choose from, products included weight 
                        whereas services did not, I then used some methods to workout the cost of delivery for products and then the total amount for all items added together including any delivery cost 
                        I also allowed for refunds to be made based on the customer requesting which items they wanted to have refunded.
